# Introduction

AvelPress is a pure PHP framework designed to streamline the development of WordPress plugins and themes. Inspired by Laravel, it brings a clean and familiar structure to WordPress development without adding unnecessary overhead.

## What is AvelPress?

AvelPress keeps the native Laravel project architecture intact, including:

- **Database layer** - Complete database abstraction
- **Migrations** - Version control for your database
- **Models** - Eloquent-style models for WordPress
- **Controllers** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Service Providers** - Modular application bootstrapping
- **Configurations** - Environment-based configuration
- **Routes** - Laravel-style routing for WordPress REST API
- **Collections** - Includes a lightweight and useful implementation of Collections, inspired by Laravel, for convenient data manipulation
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)** - Comes with a CLI tool called `avel`, similar to Laravel's Artisan, to help automate common development tasks

All of these components are carefully adapted to work seamlessly within the WordPress ecosystem.

## Goals
